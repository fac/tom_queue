module TomQueue

  # Internal: This is an internal class that oversees the delay of "deferred"
  # work, that is, work with a future :run_at value.
  #
  # DefferedWorkManager#new takes a prefix value to set up RabbitMQ exchange
  # and queue for deferred jobs
  #
  # Work is also pushed to this manager by the QueueManager when it needs to be deferred.
  #
  # For the purpose of listening to the deferred jobs queue and handling jobs when they're
  # ready to run DeferredWorkManager::start is intended to run AS A SEPARATE PROCESS
  #
  # Internally, this class opens a separate AMQP channel (without a prefetch limit) and
  # leaves all the deferred messages in an un-acked state. The process checks periodically
  # if the next message is ready to run, at which point the message is
  # published to the regular jobs queue by QueueManager, and at some point will be processed by a worker.
  #
  # If the host process of this manager dies for some reason, the broker will re-queue the
  # un-acked messages onto the deferred queue, to be re-popped by another worker in the pool.
