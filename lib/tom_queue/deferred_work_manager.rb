  # There is a singleton object for each prefix value (really, there should only be a single
  # prefix used. The queue manager ensures this thread is running whenever #pop is called.
  # Work is also pushed to this maanger by the QueueManager when it needs to be deferred.
  #
  # Internally, this class opens a separate AMQP channel (without a prefetch limit) and
  # leaves all the deferred messages in an un-acked state. An internal timer is maintained
  # to delay until the next message is ready to be sent, at which point the message is
  # dispatched back to the QueueManager, and at some point will be processed by a worker.
  #
  # If the host process of this manager dies for some reason, the broker will re-queue the
  # un-acked messages onto the deferred queue, to be re-popped by another worker in the pool.
