module TomQueue

  # Internal: This class wraps the pool of work items that are waiting for their run_at
  # time to be reached.

  # It also incorporates the logic and coordination required to stall a thread until the
  # work is ready to run.

      # shouldn't be done directly.

      #
      # NOTE: We don't compare the Time objects directly as this is /dog/ slow, as is comparing
      # float objects, and this function will be called a /lot/ - so we compare reasonably
      # accurate integer values created in the initializer.

      # When #<=> is used with `Comparable`, we get #== for free, but when it operates using run_at, it has
      # the undesirable side-effect that when Array#delete is called with an element, all other elements with
      # the same run_at are deleted, too (since #== is used by Array#delete).
