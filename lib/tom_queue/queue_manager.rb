  # Public: Priority values for QueueManager#publish
  #
  # Rather than an arbitrary numeric scale, we use distinct
  # priority values, one should be selected depending on the
  # type and use-case of the work.
  #
  # The scheduler simply trumps lower-priority jobs with higher
  # priority jobs. So ensure you don't saturate the worker with many
  # or lengthy high priority jobs as you'll negatively impact normal
  # and bulk jobs.
  #
  # HIGH_PRIORITY - use where the job is relatively short and the
  #    user is waiting on completion. For example sending a password
  #    reset email.
  #
  # NORMAL_PRIORITY - use for longer-interactive tasks (rebuilding ledgers?)
  #
  # BULK_PRIORITY - typically when you want to schedule lots of work to be done
  #   at some point in the future - background emailing, cron-triggered
  #   syncs, etc.
  #
